We give AI the raw text
We tell AI: "Organize this into title + sections"
We tell AI: "Return it as JSON format"
AI analyzes the text and creates structure
Convert JSON String to Python Dictionary

Step 1-> generate_slides_code
📚 Detailed Explanation of generate_slides_code
This function takes parsed content (JSON data) and generates Python Manim code as a string. 
This is the KEY TO CONSISTENCY - we control exactly what code is generated, not random AI!

 1. Extract data from parsed JSON -> Gets main title, defaults to "Presentation" if missing, Gets list of sections, defaults to empty list [] if missing
 2. Start building Python code as string.
 3. Loop through each section and generate code

 4. We Need to Calculate Timing

 => Imagine you have two slides:
    Slide 1: "Hi"
    Slide 2: "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in animal brains that consist of interconnected nodes called neurons organized in layers."
    If both slides stay on screen for the same time (e.g., 3 seconds):
    ❌ Slide 1: Too much time (only 1 word)
    ❌ Slide 2: Not enough time (25+ words)
    We need different timing for different content lengths!

    # STEP 3B: Calculate timing
               word_count = len(content.split())
               wait_time = max(word_count / 2.5, 5.0)

    # Reading speed: ~2.5 words/second
    # Minimum 5 seconds per slide   
    # Calculate Reading Time
      wait_time = word_count / 2.5
    # Why 2.5?
      Average reading speed: 2.5 words per second
      This is comfortable reading speed (not too fast, not too slow)

    # Short content
      word_count = 10
      wait_time = 10 / 2.5 = 4.0 seconds

    # Medium content  
      word_count = 25
      wait_time = 25 / 2.5 = 10.0 seconds

    # Long content
      word_count = 50
      wait_time = 50 / 2.5 = 20.0 seconds

   
   ## Set Minimum Time
      wait_time = max(word_count / 2.5, 5.0)
      Why max()?
      Even very short slides need at least 5 seconds
      Otherwise transitions are too fast
      Gives viewer time to process information

  Step 2 -> text_to_video
  1. Convert ANY text content to educational video with audio
  2. Works for:
    - Technical explanations
    - Educational content
    - Documentation
    - Tutorials
    - Any written content
    
    Args:
        text_content: The text you want to convert to video
        output_name: Name for output file
        
    Returns:
        dict with 'final_video' path or None if failed

  ## What is FFmpeg?
    FFmpeg = "Fast Forward MPEG" (MPEG is a video format standard)
    It's a free, open-source command-line tool for handling multimedia (video, audio, images).
    Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for media files - it can do almost anything with video/audio!

    FFmpeg can:
    ✅ Convert video formats (MP4 → AVI, MOV → WebM, etc.)
    ✅ Extract audio from video
    ✅ Combine video + audio
    ✅ Cut/trim videos
    ✅ Resize/scale videos
    ✅ Change video bitrate/quality
    ✅ Add subtitles
    ✅ Create GIFs from videos
    ✅ Stream video
    ✅ Record screen
    ✅ Much more...
  
        Manim generates:               We have:
    ┌─────────────┐               ┌─────────────┐
    │   VIDEO     │               │   AUDIO     │
    │  (silent)   │               │  (voice)    │
    │   .mp4      │               │   .aiff     │
    └─────────────┘               └─────────────┘
            ↓                             ↓
            └─────────────┬───────────────┘
                        ↓
                    ┌───────┐
                    │ FFmpeg│
                    └───────┘
                        ↓
                ┌──────────────┐
                │ FINAL VIDEO  │
                │ (with audio) │
                │    .mp4      │
                └──────────────┘

    Why We Want JSON Object Format?
      response_format={"type": "json_object"} ==> Forces OpenAI to return ONLY valid JSON (no extra text, no explanations)
    
    Without response_format:
     Sure! Here's the parsed content:

    {
    "title": "Neural Networks",
    "sections": [...]
    }
    I organized it into 3 main sections for clarity.

    ==> Problem: Extra text before/after JSON → json.loads() will crash! ❌


    When to Use response_format?
    # ✅ Use when you need:
    - Structured data like json_object
    - Consistent format
    - Data to parse programmatically
    - Integration with other systems


    # ❌ Don't use when you need:
    - Natural conversation
    - Explanations
    - Free-form text
    - Human-readable responses
